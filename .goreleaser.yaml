    # NOTE: make sure the url_template, the token and given repo (github or
    # gitlab) owner and name are from the same kind.
    # We will probably unify this in the next major version like it is
    # done with scoop.

    # URL which is determined by the given Token (github, gitlab or gitea).

    # Default depends on the client.

    # This can be a more modern alternative to `download_strategy` in some
    # cases.

    # Allows you to set a custom download strategy. Note that you'll need
    # to implement the strategy and add it to your tap repository.
    # Example: https://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook#specifying-the-download-strategy-explicitly
