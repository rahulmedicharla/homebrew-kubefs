# Getting Started

Welcome to kubefs! the command line tool to automate the creation and deployment of fullstack applications onto kubernetes cluster.

copy the repo down, run ```chmod +x kubefs.sh``` and ```sudo ln -s {PATH_TO_kubefs.sh} {PATH_TO_EXE_BINARIES}```

in this scenario, {PATH_TO_EXE_BINARIES} is something like /usr/local/bin/kubefs

then run ```kubefs init``` to download any required dependencies that don't exist & set up project
