# Getting Started

Welcome to kubefs! the command line tool to automate the creation and deployment of fullstack applications onto kubernetes cluster.

copy the repo down, and run ```make build```

this will add the kubefs cli to your usr/local/bin which should automatically make it available on the path

then run ```kubefs init``` to download any required dependencies that don't exist & set up project
